# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

In this project, I expore more of `lambda`, `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` with
interesting way of expressing my coding skills.


## Function Prototypes:

Prototypes for functions written in this project:

| File                       | Prototype                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------|
|              |                                                 |

## Tasks:

0. Squared simple
 * a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix
 * Prototype: def square_matrix_simple(matrix=[]):
 * matrix is a 2 dimensional array
 * Returns a new matrix:
  - Same size as matrix
  - Each value should be the square of the value of the input
